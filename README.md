### What is TypeScript 101

TypeScript is a programming language that enhances JavaScript by adding static typing, 
which makes it easier to write maintainable and scalable code. 

This repository contains a series of exercises that will guide you through the most 
important features of TypeScript.

Each exercise builds upon the previous one and is designed to be completed at your own pace. 
We encourage you to take the time to fully understand each concept before moving on to the next one.
